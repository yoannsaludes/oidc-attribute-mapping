# OpenID Connect Generic custom attribute mapping Must-Use Plugin

This WordPress must-use plugin provides added functionality to the [OpenID Connect Generic Plugin](https://github.com/daggerhart/openid-connect-generic) when using custom attributes.
It will add configuration fields under settings->OpenID COnnect Client where you can map an IDP-side attribute, to a Wordpress-side user meta field.
It also assigns any "groups" attribute entry, to a potential Wordpress user role.

This first version is rudimentary and was build for single-purpose.

This project is a fork from [oidc-keycloak-sso](https://github.com/timnolte/oidc-keycloak-sso).
